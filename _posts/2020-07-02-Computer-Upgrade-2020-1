Since 2013 my main Computer was a Dell XPS 2700. The original System Configuration was:

---
Motherboard: Dell 0KWVT8
CPU: Intel I7-4770 8mb Cache, 3.4GHz base clock up to 3.9GHz boost clock
Graphics Card: GeForce GT 635 1Gb DDR3
RAM: 8Gb DDR3 1600MHz Dual Channel
Storage: 1Tb HDD
PSU: Some generic PSU
---

As you can see, besides the I7, the specs were not great, even for 2013 standards. So, as from 2015, I started doing upgrades whenever I can. First I changed the Graphics Card to a Galax GTX 970 EXOC, and a PSU to a Cougar SL600, in March 2015.
Then, in 2017 I changed the Storage, going to a Kingston 120Gb Sata SSD and 2 Hitachi 2Tb HDD. From that moment on, my Computer was already significantly betther than the original Pre-Built.
But on problem remained: the chaotic mATX dell case and the zero cable management capability.

The thermals were so terrible that my regular performance was usualy guided by the Thermal Throttling on CPU and GPU. Because of that, and also because I plan to do more significant upgrades from now on, in June 2020 I bought a new case and fan.
The new case is a Thermaltake H200 TG RGB [I didn't even realised it has RGB when I bought]() and a Noctua NF-P14s Redux 1200 [Now that is a good looking fan]()
And now the Computer looks like this:

It's not the best computer in the world, but at least thermals lowered an impressive amount (about 15ÂºC improvement) even with the terrible old thermal paste that never was changed.
Stay Tuned for the next PC upgrade log!
